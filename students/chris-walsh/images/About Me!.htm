      <h3>Before coming to Red!</h3>
      <p>Before coming to Red Academy I have been working full time mostly from 6am until 2pm. During that time I also went to school in Merritt, BC to take the Foundations
    in Technology and Innovation course. After completion of the course I have decided that I wanted to pursue Web Development here at Red Academy.
      </p>

      <h3>After Red Academy!</h3>
      <p>Once completing the Web Dev course after alot of hard work, I plan to get a job in the field and to gain more experience. With that experience I hope to someday have my own business.</p>
