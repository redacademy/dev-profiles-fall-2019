                <h2 class="title">Who?</h2>
                <p>My name is <strong>Kieran Devlin</strong>  and I am a web developer in training!</p>
            </article>

                <h2 class="title">What?</h2>
                <p>What was I doing before RED you ask? Well, let me tell you! I was trying out a variety of industries. I briefly worked in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list">Automotive - maintenance/detailing</li>
                    <li class="list">Banking</li>
                    <li class="list">Fine Finishing</li>
                    <li class="list">Video Production</li>
                    <li class="list">Social Media Management</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Another 'what' question you may be asking is - What <em>is</em> my secret talent? Well, if you have met me in person, you may find out rather quickly that I have a talent for entertaining and making people laugh. I am inherently a people-person, I love being around people and people love laughing - so everybody wins! </p>

            <h2 class="title">When?</h2>
            <p>A little, interesting fact about me would be this: I have always been a perfectionist. From the age of a young child, to the age of a slightly older child. When I try something, it has to be perfect. It is a blessing and a curse. Being hyper-critical some times gives me the benefit of not providing sloppy, or below average quality results.</p>

        <section id="where">
            <img class="mountain" src="images/mountains.svg" alt="An icon of mountains.">
            <h2 class="title">Where?</h2>
            <p>My hometown is <a href="https://www.exploresquamish.com/">Squamish, BC</a>. The pinnacle of outdoor activities, where both me and my family are ironically the absolute opposite. We are an indoor family - mostly comprised of musicians. </p>
            <p>My greatest travel experience was by far a month long backpacking trip to Europe with my wife. We traveled by rail from Paris, to Nice, to Rome, to Zurich, to Frankfurt, to Amersterdam, to Brussels, and ended our journey in London. It was by far my greatest travel experience because it was hard. It was a wonderful time, but it was hard. I love things to be organized, and this whole trip, my wife and I were moving 'by the seat of our pants' - so to speak. It required me to really focus on practicing patience and accepting inevitable failure in our haphazard planning. My wife and I learned alot about each other, and how we both manage our traveling expectations. </p>
            <p>Where do I see myself after completing <a href="https://redacademy.com/vancouver/">Red Academy's</a> full-stack program you say? In a perfect world, landing a jr dev position in a start-up company in the downtown Vancouver area. My second option would be to prepare myself for freelance work and travel the world with my wife. We are open to both options!</p>
