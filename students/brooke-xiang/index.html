            <title>Hi! I'm Brooke</title>
            <!--Hi there! I suspect that if you're reading this, you're very likely to be one of my instructors (hello to anybody else who might be reading this too). I wanted to take the time to tell you a bit about my learning habits and history so we can have the most productive six months possible. 

            As a student, I'm generally motivated by the big picture. What I mean by this is that while I'm happy to dive right in, like for this project, I need to know the how and why behind why something is done before I can do it full-heartedly. I find I apply knowledge best when I've had time to understand the overarching theories and principles, and I internalize information best when I've been given the time to play around with possibilities. I tend to take a bit longer to gather information before I feel like I have a enough to work with to know how to begin. This might come across as hesitation, but is actually just how I function as a person. Please expect lots of questions from me; some of these questions might seem tangential, but I promise my brain is putting the answers in some useful place!

            I will be on a very steep learning curve, as this pre-work assignment is my first ever experience with coding (besides the logic games and coding games for children here and there). While I'm fairly confident that my diligence and hyperfocus will carry me through (thank you ADHD), I do very much appreciate your patience and support throughout this process. Onwards and upwards! -->

                <h2>Hometown</h2>
                    <p>Toronto, ON</p>
                <h2>Life Before RED</h2>
                    <p>I completed my MA in English at the University of British Columbia in November 2018, then subsequently worked for the Canada Revenue Agency until Aug 2019. I'm happy to chat about any and all topics besides taxes.</p>
                <h2>Interesting Fact(s)</h2>
                    <p>This seems like a good opportunity to incorporate the &lt;ul&gt; element:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>I served for seven years in the Royal Canadian Navy, as a musician, then as a commissioned officer</li>
                            <li>I play ultimate frisbee at the competitive level</li>
                            <li>I used to sing professionally with a big band</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>But I'd rather not let these things define me or our impending interactions at RED!</p>
                <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>
                    <p>As a graduation present to myself after my BA, I took a VIARail train ride from Vancouver to Toronto. The Rockies were majestic as one would and will always be told to expect, but what won me over was the night sky over the prairies, the ever expanding, all consuming darkness dotted with bright stars. It was here that I finally learned what it means to be breathlessly in awe. </p>
                <h2>Secret Talent</h2>
                    <p>Please let me know if <strong style="color: darksalmon">you</strong> discover any!</p>
                <h2>Life After RED</h2>
                    <p>I read somewhere once that one is more likely to achieve a goal if it isn't spoken out loud - something to do with how saying it will give a person the same sense of satisfaction as if they'd already achieved the goal itself, as result of which one's motivation diminishes with each utterance. I suspect the same goes for writing them down in a bio. Forgive me for keeping this one a secret; I have so much I want to do.</p>
                <h2>Anything else?</h2>
                    <p>Since the point of this assignment is to try our hands at HTML and CSS, I thought I'd throw in one of my favourite videos. It features the best parts of life - musicality, originality, humour, and serendipity. More importantly, it's a triumphant reminder that the human body and its functions are wonderful, and that life is too short to hold things in, or to take ourselves too seriously.</p>
