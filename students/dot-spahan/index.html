    <h1>Henle - Hello, My traditional name is Spaqm</h1>
    <p>Just some written information about where i come from, here is a short exerpt from the First Voices website "One of the stories of how the Scw̓̓éxmx (people of the Creeks, Nicola Valley) came together was loooong ago the Stuwix, who were the Athapascan Nicola-Similkameen, had frequent wars with the Nłeʔkepmx (the Lytton people) & the Nsyilx. The Nłeʔkepmx drove them away & the Stuwix occupied which is now Nicola Valley. The Nłeʔkepmx ceased to attack the Stuwix after they had intermarried, as they were afraid of killing their own family. The Cutxʷewt (Nsyilx) for the same reason also made fast friends with the Nłeʔkepmx & became their allies, & ceased to attack the Stuwix. During the past century the Nłeʔkepmx, Stuwix & Cutxʷewt (Nsyilx) never fought with one another." Reference: FirstVoices.ca
