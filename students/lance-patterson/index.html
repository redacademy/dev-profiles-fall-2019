    <h2>Life Before Red</h2>
    <p>I've always loved computers. When I was a kid, I would use my neighbours PC after class in the grade four to play on the computer. <br>
    Later in my life; I would end up buying a PC then learn how to use the basics of photoshop to edit my dad's photos to sell his artwork. </p>
    <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>
    <p>My best travel experience was going to Japan back in late 2017. I spent about two months exploring Tokyo, and Kyoto. <br>
    I think I will go back once I get a better understanding of the language so I can fully experience Japan.</p>
