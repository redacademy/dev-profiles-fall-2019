        <h3>Thanks you for taking the time to get to know me....</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            <br>
            My name is Percy and I was born and raised in Vancouver BC.
            <br>I grew up in East Van, but I'm currently residing in the city of Surrey.<br>
            Career wise I've worked for a company called Costco for over 25 years.<br>
            After I left, I worked for the City of Vancouver as a Parking Enforcement <br>Officer.
            <br>Did that for 2 years and decided to move on to bigger and better things to <br>satisfy 
            my quest for knowledge.<br>

            In my spare time I like to join my bike club and go for a ride all along <br>the west end.
            I also have my beautiful daughter Brooklyn, she's 6 years <br>old going on 14!

        <h2>SuperPowers</h2> 
        <br>
        <p>
            My main super powers include the ability to physically take apart most objects<br> and put them
            back together,with very few extra parts,for the most part.
            <br>I also have the power of intense <br>focus. When I'm working on a task or project I can mentally
            tune out <br>99.97548821% of my enviroment out.
            <br><br>This power is often referred to as the "Selective Wife Listening power."
