<h3> I was born and raised in Brazil - SP
	<p>I have been leaving in beautiful Vancouver for 6 years</p>
<h2> - Life before RED </h2>
	<p> I have been a Pastry Cook for 5 years. I love baking, decorating and creating new flavours combinations. About 6 months ago, I discovered coding and I realized that developing can be as fun as making cakes !!! <p>
		<h2> - Secret Talent </H2>
			<p> My secret talent is photographing. I love taking pictures of family,friends and pets. I can spend hours editing pictures but I do only for fun.
				
				<h2> - Best travel experience </h2>
				<p> Backpacking trip with my sister in US and Canada </p>

				<h2> - Big Plans </h2>
				<p> When I decided this year that I wanted to study Web Development I decided that I was going to put even more effort into that than for my former career. I really hope I can reap the fruits of my hard work in school and start working in the field right after school.
