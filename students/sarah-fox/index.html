                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born in the USA, but grew up in Victoria, BC in an idyllic town full of horse drawn carriages, old people and a ton of Satanists. <br><br> I moved to Vancouver in 2009 to study film and acting at university. I usually got cast as somebody's quirky girlfriend or a murderer -- that was pretty much my entire range.<br><br> Most of my work prior to Red Academy has been in the film industry as a freelancer. I've done a lot of different jobs, but the ones I spent the more time on were: video editor, audio engineer and screenwriter.</p>

                <h2>Even More About Me</h2>
                <p>In my spare time I love playing video games, listening to podcasts, reading and watching way too many TV shows. <br><br> I host and produce a Dungeons & Dragons podcast called <a href="https://adventureexe.podbean.com" target="_blank">Adventure.exe</a>. We just hit a big milestone: three years, 100 episodes and 100,000 downloads!<br><br> My goal for when I finish this course is to get a front-end developer office job where I can be around people. I've lived too long in the horrific isolation of working from home and I'm ready to rejoin society. An office dog would be a nice perk, but at this point I'd take an office possum.</p>
